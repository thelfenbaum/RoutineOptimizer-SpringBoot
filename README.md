# RoutineOptimizer-SpringBoot

<h2> What is This Project? </h2>
This is a project I built for a Software Design Course at the University of Toronto. </p>

<b>Basic concept:</b> scheduling application to help optimize one's routine in 1 of 2 ways: schedule an item at a concrete time, or get the program to schedule a task (or set of tasks) for you based on your availability. This concept was motivated by my experiences waiting many weeks for a learning strategist on campus to schedule tasks like this with me </p>
<b>Stack information:</b> full stack web application with PostgreSQL database, Spring boot backend and Vanilla JavaScript/CSS/HTML frontend </p>

This project was extremely important for my development as a software engineer for a number of reasons, including:
- It was my first time designing software from scratch, and I put a lot of thought into the concept and architecture
- I was introduced to many techniques for ideal architecture, based in SOLID Principles and Clearn Architecture
- It was my first time working with a team using agile methodology
- I had a lot of fun developing the scheduling algorithms

Some reflections on this project:
- The design emphasis and documentation was so time consuming that the quality of code suffered in order to meet the necessary deadlines
- The algorithms are quite greedy, scheduling all tasks in first empty slot, which does not necessarily produce the spread out schedule a user might want

Both these issues could be fixed with some extra time, if I decide to make it a priority
